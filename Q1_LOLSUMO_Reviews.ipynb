I don‚Äôt even pay (not yet at least) and it gives me a great basic overview of my play, which I‚Äôve been able to improve now. One strange thing to me, though, for those who designed this app: it seems that kill participation is not always an accurate measurement of a player‚Äôs performance during a match. For example, if you‚Äôre playing adc, and your top laner does exceptionally well in laning phase, the amount you participate in the total kills for your team will seem to reflect that you did poorly. It‚Äôs not very reasonable to have a system where the better your teammates perform when you can‚Äôt help them, the worse overall score you get on the app.',\n",

       "    'content': 'LOLSUMO is great if you use it for figuring out what you do best in a match and what needs to be worked on. Before I used less wards and didn‚Äôt focus much on cs. After getting LOLSUMO, I became a lot better with every one of my champions by getting more engaged in team fights, getting more cs, warding more often, and doing so much better overall. I practically get an S -/+ every 3 matches depending on my teams and performance (since lol is a team game). I also use lol for the tips it gives when going against champs on the other team. It sometimes tells you what to do if you engage with them, what items to build and often whether you should just avoid them in general when possible. I‚Äôm often sure there much more with LOLSUMO because I‚Äôm still a noob with this app and the fact that there is a premium option but this is enough to help me get better with my champions.

Wie die anderen Rezensionen schon beschrieben haben handelt es sich um eine sehr gute App. Komisch finde ich manchmal nur die vorgeschlagenen Runen- und ItemBuilds die manchmal total von den Builds anderer Websites abweichen. LOLSUMO hatte mir zB vorschlagen executioners calling und direkt danach morello auf Kog zu kaufen. W√§re das nicht doppelt gemoppelt ? Da ich auch nur ein Silber pleb bin, bin ich mir jedoch nicht sicher ob es vielleicht nicht doch der richtige Build in der Situation war. Auch anderen Stellen wundert man sich manchmal √ºber die Item Builds (rod of ages first auf blitz?). Trotzdem ist es eine super App und ich habe auch seit ich sie benutze eine h√∂here winrate, deswegen m√∂chte ich Sie auf keinen Fall schlecht bewerten.',\n",

Now I see that, it is written down in description that, there will be a subscription options. But you don't expect that from pre-paid app! So I skipped reading and was surprised further. All monthly unpaid features (i mean when u bought an app but did not subscribe for a monthly pay) should be free. Buying app which makes u pay more is a garbage. Its was a trap. In some reason, the button 'Get It' did not have the price tag it was just 'Get It' and that's it. In few seconds, - PayPal: 'You have just paid 4+ GBP to blah-blah-blah'. I was like, - 'Oka-a-ay. You better to be a very good app then'. Opening it, does not give anything, like literally, but asks to pay 6.99 monthly. What the hell, tho? At least you should give a trial period, so u know do u want to subscribe or not, or is it worth the amount. Change the prices policy! I dont know, but I played two games without using app, and after I finished I went to check of what app can suggest regarding recent plays what, is quite a common thing - checking how well you did afterwards because, during the load you think about other stuff, like what to do and who to gank first or babysit and what camp to start or what items to rush if u on lane. But app says 'it seems that, you haven't played ant game yet', after I played two. Fine! I don't know. Do I use the app wrong? Are these pre-paid features aimed to help or I just paid to have funny Lee Sin icon on my phone?\",\n",

Basically I wouldn't look at SPI for what level of play you have I'd go to op.gg and see your MMR. I'd recommend this app to any new league player but for anyone that's played league for more than a year this apps a no\",\n",

       "    'content': \"It gives you builds for certain situations, runes and masteries, info about your opponent and how well they have done with the camp they are playing. The only problem I have is, they use the same grading system for all lanes. And this grading system weighs very heavy on your creep score. This can be very inconvenient if you get autofilled to support. Since the support role is supposed to give all the creeps to the ADC, the support generally doesn't even break into the 50's when it comes to creep score. However I do realize it is easier to make a standardized system so it doesn't get confused or give you the wrong build if you switch roles during ban/pick phase. Other than that, it's really helpful and it makes me feel like a better player than I probably am which is good because solo queue is rough.\",\n",

I don‚Äôt even pay (not yet at least) and it gives me a great basic overview of my play, which I‚Äôve been able to improve now. One strange thing to me, though, for those who designed this app: it seems that kill participation is not always an accurate measurement of a player‚Äôs performance during a match. For example, if you‚Äôre playing adc, and your top laner does exceptionally well in laning phase, the amount you participate in the total kills for your team will seem to reflect that you did poorly.

       " '  first of all i really like the app and i\\'m actually using it a lot, but there are a few things i\\'d like to talk about:  1) the rating for cs on support role is still completely random, like you can get 2 different ratings for exactly the same cs/min on the same champion in 2 seperate games, and i think one time i even got bronze for not taking any cs at all as a non-relic support. btw i also think i\\'ve never gotten any better grade than gold for cs on supp  2) in my opinion the vision (score) is a bit overrated in the spi rating. you can easily boost you spi just by taking zombie ward in the runes (which kinda compensates the messed up cs rating on support mentioned above)  3) i\\'d highly appreciate if the damage dealt to champions (or maybe to structures/objectives as well) or dmg/min would be part of the spi calculation as well (of course in relation to the type of champion you play - tank/support/mage/adc/etc) since it is a major indicator for how well you\\'ve played in my opinion, at least on roles like adc, mage, dmg supp, whereas on tanks you could maybe take the damage taken into account instead  4) i really like the fact that the app doesn\\'t record remakes since they could massively screw your overall spi rating, but today i played two games the enemy team surrendered before the 20min mark (the \"early surrender\" you can do after 15min, so definitely no remake) which didn\\'t get recorded - or shown in the match history, aka \"feed\" - as well. probably just a mistake in the rules for games to not be recorded that could easily be fixed  5) i think the sumo lab is quite useless as it is now since it only shows you a single rune page for each champion, without giving any further information - like win rate or play rate, total games played etc - for the rune pages or a comparison between different rune pages for each champion. maybe you could include stuff like builds and skill orders there as well, so you could use the app as an overall information source  6) the price for the pro version of the app could be a bit lower in my opionion, but that\\'s probably something where you can\\'t listen to people\\'s opinions since you need to make at least some profit with the app i guess  ',\n",

though for those who designed this app it seems that kill participation is not always an accurate measurement of a player‚Äôs performance during a match for example if you‚Äôre playing adc and your top laner does exceptionally well in laning phase the amount you participate in the total kills for your team will seem to reflect that you did poorly it‚Äôs not very reasonable to have a system where

performance tracking however i did notice that there should be things that could be added for example when you click the gg button when you start a game it should show you the entire build not just core secondly when you search for the champions in the champions bar it should say a full list of items and multiple list to compare on what people are running same goes for the runes they shouldnt

index of your previous games mt good', 'i came by fenixytb and i liked the app mt because of the runes mt times i have to keep looking at sites  agr eh just open the app and thats it', '  first of all i really like the app and im actually using it a lot but there are a few things id like to talk about  1 the rating for cs on support role is still completely random like you can get 2 different ratings for exactly the same csmin on the same champion in 2 seperate games and i think one time i even got bronze for not taking any cs at all as a nonrelic support btw i also think ive never gotten any better grade than gold for cs on supp  2 in my opinion the vision score is a bit overrated in the spi rating you can easily boost you spi just by taking zombie ward in the runes which kinda compensates the messed up cs rating on support mentioned above  3 id highly appreciate if the damage dealt to champions or maybe to structuresobjectives as well or dmgmin would be part of the spi calculation as well of course in relation to the type of champion you play  tanksupportmageadcetc since it is a major indicator for how well youve played in my opinion at least on roles like adc mage dmg supp whereas on tanks you could maybe take the damage taken into account instead  4 i really like the fact that the app doesnt record remakes since they could massively screw your overall spi rating but today i played two games the enemy team surrendered before the 20min mark the early surrender you can do after 15min so definitely no remake which didnt get recorded  or shown in the match history aka feed  as well probably just a mistake in the rules for games to not be recorded that could easily be fixed  5 i think the sumo lab is quite useless as it is now since it only shows you a single rune page for each champion without giving any further information  like win rate or play rate total games played etc  for the rune pages or a comparison between different rune pages for each champion maybe you could include stuff like builds and skill orders there as well so you could use the app as an overall information source  6 the price for the pro version of the app could be a bit lower in my opionion but thats probably something where you cant listen to peoples opinions since you need to make at least some profit with the app i guess  ', 'no or less', 'it helped my lolzin a lot', 'just needs to be translated', 'i feel sorry that i have to pay for it', 'only need to be in portuguese', 'what a yum expensive guy app', 'you have no reviews', '  great app  im loving it  ',

pay what do i buy', 'the application has improved a lot since the last time i downloaded but it has not yet been translated into portuguese which for many even me is difficult to understand ', '  look the apps mostly great but i do have some qualms lets for example i dont find kill participation should be graded so hard instead i feel that objectturret damage needs to be a stat after all this game is not about kills it is about the objectives yknow also there shouldnt be a standard single build against any one champion there needs to be options the same goes for runes id say bot scoring is inaccurate because your support is a variable that cant be calculated other than that its pretty good really what im hoping for here is for yall to incorporate the objectives system that i mentioned im enjoying pro and i would like to thank anyone who read all of this if youre a user scrolling through the reviews can you let me know your thoughts as well again thanks for the time  ', '  the coolest   ', 'so missing to translate ptbr', 'i came to check for gordox', 'wonderful app helps a lot ', 'so should have in portuguese but rest great app', 'i think lolsumo is very cool but could have

features are not included in the free version and the app is slow  ', 'i think the idea is good the only problem is k you have to pay for various features', 'great app not difficult to understand and works well but unfortunately almost all options are paid', 'the principle is good but it does not show me all the games so this app is actually pretty much unnecessary for me too bad that you have to pay something to see more', '  its pretty dumb that only pro players can actually utilize the full extent and the most important features of the app while we normal people can only use some  features it should be public for everyone so that they can climb faster  ', 'i came by fenix', 'very good but please translate the app', 'need a translation into brazilian portuguese graro', 'the application is good but for those who do not understand much of english if it loses a little in the app', 'it looks good but it is not in portuguese if one day i find it very difficult to stay in portuguese i

since most do not even need to read just see runas builds and adversaries  add counters of champions pls', 'i only say a shameful thing  instead of making the application available it solves it at a cost in cash so we can see our full statuses  they would help a lot of people needing to improve in the game ', 'great tool for comparing match ups and really useful to improve mechanically with bits like the map coverage score i use it personally to check in on my opponents experience and who i should focus as jungler if im facing a high gold low plat nasus or trynda on top  i know he needs to be shut down early gold vayne bots getting ganked its useful for little things like that things that used correctly can actually have a very big impact in game']\n"
